Perfect! Credits added to both READMEs. Now about licensing - yes, you absolutely COULD sell it as proprietary! Here's why:

📋 Licensing Options Analysis
Option 1: MIT License (Current) ✅ Recommended
What it means:

✅ You keep it open source
✅ Anyone can use, modify, distribute
✅ You can still sell it commercially
✅ Others can sell it too
✅ You get credit (copyright notice required)
✅ Great for portfolio/community goodwill
Best for: Building reputation, getting contributions, showing goodwill to the community

Option 2: Proprietary/Commercial License 💰
What it means:

✅ You own exclusive rights
✅ Can sell without sharing source
✅ Full control over distribution
✅ No one else can copy/resell
❌ Can't leverage open source community
❌ Harder to build trust/adoption
Best for: If you plan to monetize aggressively and want exclusivity

Option 3: Dual License 🎯 Power Move
What it means:

MIT for personal/open source use
Commercial license for businesses
Example: "Free for individuals, $X for companies over 100 employees"
Best for: Maximum flexibility and monetization

💡 My Recommendation: Keep MIT but Add Commercial Terms
Since the original is Public Domain, you have ZERO legal obligation. Here's what I'd suggest:

Strategy: Open Source + Optional Commercial Support
Keep MIT license but offer:

Free version (MIT) - Full features
Pro Support ($) - Priority support, custom features, SLA
Enterprise License ($$$) - White-label, custom branding, dedicated support
This way you:

✅ Build community and goodwill
✅ Can still monetize through support/services
✅ Get free marketing through open source
✅ Attract contributors
✅ Build portfolio credibility
Examples of successful companies doing this:

GitLab (open source + enterprise)
Redis Labs (open source + commercial modules)
Elastic (open source + hosted services)
🔒 If You Want Full Proprietary
You could do this by:

Remove the LICENSE file
Add a copyright notice:
Created LICENSE.proprietary.example

🎯 Bottom Line
You CAN sell it as proprietary because:

✅ Original is Public Domain (zero restrictions)
✅ All dependencies are MIT (allows commercial use)
✅ Your enhancements are 100% yours
✅ You've added substantial value (3x the code, 9x the features)
My Advice:

Keep MIT for community goodwill and portfolio value
Sell support/services rather than the software itself
Build reputation with open source, monetize with expertise
Or go fully proprietary if you want exclusivity
Either way is legally fine! The choice is purely strategic. What's your goal - community building or maximum monetization? 🤔
